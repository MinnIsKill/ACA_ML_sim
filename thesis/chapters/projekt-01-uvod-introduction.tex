\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap-intro}

\noindent TO ASK: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item should the theoretical part contain any reference to the practical one, i.e. mentioning which concrete biological phenomena is the subject of the thesis?  NO
	\item should I also explain the biological phenomena in question (i.e. what Mitosis is)?  
	\item should I include the boring stuff, i.e. history of CA, its application in other fields etc.?
\end{itemize}

\section{Motivation and Objectives}
[why CA in Biological simulations, what was the main focus of the thesis, what was achieved, summary of each individual chapter]
