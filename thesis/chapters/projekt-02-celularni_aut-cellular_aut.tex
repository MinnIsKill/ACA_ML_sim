\chapter{Cellular Automata}
\label{chap-ca}

Lorem ipsum

\section{Formal Definitions}
[self-explanatory - what is CA, how it works (may make the next subsection a subsubsection of this one)]
\subsection{Elementary Cellular Automata}
\subsection{Asynchronous Cellular Automata}

\section{Neighborhood and Boundary Conditions}
\subsection{Rule Complexity}
[explain that rule complexity grows with number of neighbouring cells - but somehow stretch the explanation]

\section{Asynchronous Approach}
[Fully asynchronous updating vs. alpha-asynchronous updating]

\section{Cellular automata in biological systems}
[describe possible use-cases of cellular automata in simulation of biological phenomena and weight the pros and cons of an 
asynchronous approach in this field]
\subsection{Determinism vs Probabilism}
[introduce both terms to the reader: Deterministic CA = behavior is entirely dependent on rules, initial conditions and boundary 
conditions. Probabilistic CA = outcome of rule is selected stochastically between several options. Multiple valid outcomes (rules) are 
created for each configuration of the neighbourhood, where each rule is assigned a probability of being selected (this approach is 
better to insert a degree of randomness)]
